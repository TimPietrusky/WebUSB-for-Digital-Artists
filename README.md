_I'm using [Dekk](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/dekk) for my slides, that's why certain functionality (such as mobile optimization and touch-events to change the slides) are not here yet. I'm sorry for that, but Dekk is the most advanced slides-framework I know and I need to have custom slides as much as possible!_
